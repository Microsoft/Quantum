# Measuring Qubits

This sample demonstrates:
- The use of measurement operations to measure one or more qubits, getting classical data back that can be used in classical logic.
- How to use assertions to build tests for expected behaviour of operations that involve measurements.
- Resetting previously allocated qubits.

In Q#, the most basic measurement operation is the [`M`](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/qsharp/microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.m) operation, which measures a single qubit in the _computational basis_ (sometimes also called the ùëç-basis).
In this sample, we show how `M` can be used to sample random numbers, and to measure registers of qubits.

## Prerequisites

- The Microsoft [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/install-guide/).

## Running the Sample

This sample can be run in a number of different ways, depending on your preferred environment.

### Python in Visual Studio Code or the Command Line

At a terminal, run the following command:

```bash
python host.py
```

### C# in Visual Studio Code or the Command Line

At a terminal, run the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run
```

### C# in Visual Studio 2019

Open the `getting-started.sln` solution in Visual Studio and set `measurement/Measurement.csproj` as the startup project.
Press Start in Visual Studio to run the sample.
