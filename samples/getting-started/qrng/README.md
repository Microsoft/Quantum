# Creating random numbers with quantum computing

This sample implements a quantum random number generator, a very simple application that is useful to learn how to write a first Q# code and it's integration with the host programs in C# or Python.

In the Q# code (Qrng.qs) you can find the code for extracting a random bit using quantum measurements over a qubit in superposition. For more information, you can take a look at the [full tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/quickstarts/qrng).

In the classical code (Host.cs for C# and host.py for Python) you will find the code to create a random integer from 0 to a maximum integer by invoking several times the Q# operation for extracting a random bit.


## Prerequisites ##

- The Microsoft [Quantum Development Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/install-guide/).

## Running the Sample ##

This sample can be run in a number of different ways, depending on your preferred environment.

### Python in Visual Studio Code or the Command Line ###

At a terminal, run the following command:

```bash
python host.py
```

### C# in Visual Studio Code or the Command Line ###

At a terminal, run the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet run
```

### C# in Visual Studio 2019 ###

Open the `algorithms.sln` solution in Visual Studio, then right-click on **Qrng** and select "Set As StartUp Project."
Press Start in Visual Studio to run the sample.
