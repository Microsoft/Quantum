# Runtime Samples #

These samples show how to work with the Q# simulation runtime.

- **[Oracle Emulation](./oracle-emulation)**:
  This sample shows how to provide accelerated simulation functionality for different Q# operations and functions.
- **[Simulator with Overrides](./simulator-with-overrides)**:
  This sample shows how to create a quantum simulator which relies on a full state quantum simulator and redefines some of the built-in operations.
- **[State Visualizer](./state-visualizer)**:
  This sample demonstrates how to integrate the Quantum Development Kit with web development technologies to provide interactive visualizations.
